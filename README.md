Clone this repository into your home folder. (~/dotFiles)

```
chmod a+x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The install script installs all files into the parent directory

For OSX setup the DOTFILE_DIR variable in the install_osx.sh to point to the directory where you cloned the directory.
After adjusting the variable run the shell script

```
chmod a+x install_osx.sh
./install_osx.sh
```
